00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,630
between our neuron and the neurons from
the first layer these weights are just

482
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:17,640
the first layer these weights are just
 

483
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,190
the first layer these weights are just
numbers then take all of those

484
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200
numbers then take all of those
 

485
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,590
numbers then take all of those
activations from the first layer and

486
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,600
activations from the first layer and
 

487
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,870
activations from the first layer and
compute their weighted sum according to

488
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
compute their weighted sum according to
 

489
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,550
compute their weighted sum according to
these

490
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
these
 

491
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,670
these
weights I find it helpful to think of

492
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
weights I find it helpful to think of
 

493
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,030
weights I find it helpful to think of
these weights as being being organized

494
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,040
these weights as being being organized
 

495
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,630
these weights as being being organized
into a little grid of their own and I'm

496
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
into a little grid of their own and I'm
 

497
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,310
into a little grid of their own and I'm
going to use green pixels to indicate

498
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
going to use green pixels to indicate
 

499
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,069
going to use green pixels to indicate
positive weights and red pixels to

500
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:36,079
positive weights and red pixels to
 

501
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,829
positive weights and red pixels to
indicate negative weights where the

502
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
indicate negative weights where the
 

503
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,230
indicate negative weights where the
brightness of that pixel is some loose

504
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
brightness of that pixel is some loose
 

505
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,030
brightness of that pixel is some loose
depiction of the weights value now if we

506
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
depiction of the weights value now if we
 

507
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,750
depiction of the weights value now if we
made the weights associated with almost

508
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:44,760
made the weights associated with almost
 

509
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,030
made the weights associated with almost
all of the pixel zero except for some

510
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
all of the pixel zero except for some
 

511
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,829
all of the pixel zero except for some
positive weights in this region that we

512
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
positive weights in this region that we
 

513
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,470
positive weights in this region that we
care about then taking the weighted sum

514
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,480
care about then taking the weighted sum
 

515
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,470
care about then taking the weighted sum
of all the pixel values really just

516
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,480
of all the pixel values really just
 

517
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,230
of all the pixel values really just
amounts to adding up the values of the

518
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,240
amounts to adding up the values of the
 

519
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,949
amounts to adding up the values of the
pixel just in the region that we care

520
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:57,959
pixel just in the region that we care
 

521
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,030
pixel just in the region that we care
about and if if you really wanted to

522
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,040
about and if if you really wanted to
 

523
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,590
about and if if you really wanted to
pick up on whether there's an edge here

524
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:02,600
pick up on whether there's an edge here
 

525
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,190
pick up on whether there's an edge here
what you might do is have some negative

526
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,200
what you might do is have some negative
 

527
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,470
what you might do is have some negative
weights associated with the surrounding

528
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
weights associated with the surrounding
 

529
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,310
weights associated with the surrounding
pixels then the sum is largest when

530
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,320
pixels then the sum is largest when
 

531
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,990
pixels then the sum is largest when
those middle pixels are bright but the

532
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
those middle pixels are bright but the
 

533
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,590
those middle pixels are bright but the
surrounding pixels are

534
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
surrounding pixels are
 

535
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,910
surrounding pixels are
darker when you compute a weighted sum

536
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
darker when you compute a weighted sum
 

537
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,829
darker when you compute a weighted sum
like this you might come out with any

538
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
like this you might come out with any
 

539
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,190
like this you might come out with any
number but for this network what we want

540
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,200
number but for this network what we want
 

541
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,150
number but for this network what we want
is for activations to be some value

542
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
is for activations to be some value
 

543
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,829
is for activations to be some value
between 0o and one so a common thing to

544
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:24,839
between 0o and one so a common thing to
 

545
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,389
between 0o and one so a common thing to
do is to pump this weighted sum into

546
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:27,399
do is to pump this weighted sum into
 

547
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,069
do is to pump this weighted sum into
some function that squishes the real

548
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:29,079
some function that squishes the real
 

549
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,710
some function that squishes the real
number number line into the range

550
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
number number line into the range
 

551
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,230
number number line into the range
between 0 and 1 and a common function

552
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
between 0 and 1 and a common function
 

553
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,030
between 0 and 1 and a common function
that does this is called the sigmoid

554
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
that does this is called the sigmoid
 

555
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,030
that does this is called the sigmoid
function also known as a logistic curve

556
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,040
function also known as a logistic curve
 

557
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,150
function also known as a logistic curve
basically very negative inputs end up

558
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
basically very negative inputs end up
 

559
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,550
basically very negative inputs end up
close to zero very positive inputs end

560
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
close to zero very positive inputs end
 

561
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,750
close to zero very positive inputs end
up close to one and it just steadily

562
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:44,760
up close to one and it just steadily
 

563
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,350
up close to one and it just steadily
increases around the input

564
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,360

 

565
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,150

zero so the activation of the neuron

566
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,160
zero so the activation of the neuron
 

567
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,910
zero so the activation of the neuron
here is basically a measure of how

568
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
here is basically a measure of how
 

569
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,829
here is basically a measure of how
positive the relevant weighted sum

570
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:56,839
positive the relevant weighted sum
 

571
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,389
positive the relevant weighted sum
is but maybe it's not that you want the

572
00:10:59,389 --> 00:10:59,399
is but maybe it's not that you want the
 

573
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,990
is but maybe it's not that you want the
neuron to light up when the weighted sum

574
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,000
neuron to light up when the weighted sum
 

575
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,230
neuron to light up when the weighted sum
is bigger than zero maybe you only want

576
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
is bigger than zero maybe you only want
 

577
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,190
is bigger than zero maybe you only want
it to be active when the sum is bigger

578
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
it to be active when the sum is bigger
 

579
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,910
it to be active when the sum is bigger
than say 10 that is you want some bias

580
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
than say 10 that is you want some bias
 

581
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,190
than say 10 that is you want some bias
for it to be

582
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
for it to be
 

583
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,710
for it to be
inactive what we'll do then is just add

584
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
inactive what we'll do then is just add
 

585
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,550
inactive what we'll do then is just add
in some other number like -10 to this

586
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:15,560
in some other number like -10 to this
 

587
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,829
in some other number like -10 to this
weighted sum before plugging it through

the sigmoid squish ification function
 

591
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,430

that additional number is called the

592
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,440
that additional number is called the
 

593
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,629
that additional number is called the
bias so the weights tell you what pixel

594
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:25,639
bias so the weights tell you what pixel
 

595
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,310
bias so the weights tell you what pixel

597
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,230
pattern this neuron in the second layer
is picking up on and the bias tells you

598
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
is picking up on and the bias tells you
 

599
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,550
is picking up on and the bias tells you
how high the weighted sum needs to be

600
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
how high the weighted sum needs to be
 

601
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,990
how high the weighted sum needs to be
before the neuron starts getting

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
before the neuron starts getting
 

603
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,310
before the neuron starts getting
meaningfully active and that is just one

604

each one of those 784 connections has

612
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
each one of those 784 connections has
 

613
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,990

that you add on to the weighted sum

618
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:55,959
that you add on to the weighted sum
 

619
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,389
that you add on to the weighted sum
before squishing it with the sigmoid and

before squishing it with the sigmoid and
 

621
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,150
before squishing it with the sigmoid and
that's a lot to think about about with

622
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
that's a lot to think about about with
 

623
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,670
that's a lot to think about about with
this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a

help training or it was very difficult

964
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
help training or it was very difficult
 

965
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,630
help training or it was very difficult
to train it's at some point and people

966
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
to train it's at some point and people
 

967
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,470

just tried ra you and it happened to

968
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,480
just tried ra you and it happened to
 

969
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,029

work very well for these incredibly um

970
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
work very well for these incredibly um
 

971
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,549
work very well for these incredibly um
deep neural networks all right thank you

972
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:25,559
deep neural networks all right thank you
 

973
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,960
deep neural networks all right thank you
